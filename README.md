# ProjectApp 

What does this app do? 
This app allows you to learn about different animals with sound and a fact about them. Click the image of the animal you want to learn about to see the image on the front page. Click the play button to hear the animal sound. Hover over the animal's image to see a fact about them. Use the form to add your own animal and see it on the page. (will not stay when refreshed.)
